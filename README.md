# IMAGE-SEGMENTATION-USING-PYTORCH
<br><br>
Description	<br> The main objective of this project is to build an ML model to segment the object from the environment and produce desired optimized Ground truth images. In addition, Albumentations library is used as an optimizer to the segmentation dataset to make a cost-effective model for integration.<br><br>
